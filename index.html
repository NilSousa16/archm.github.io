        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Smart Cities</strong> can be defined as urban centers that utilize digital <strong>data-driven technologies</strong> to optimize public services and increase <strong>resource use efficiency</strong>. A <strong>Smart City</strong> is composed of six main components: <strong>smart governance</strong>, <strong>smart economy</strong>, <strong>smart citizens</strong>, <strong>smart mobility</strong>, <strong>smart environment</strong>, and <strong>smart quality of life</strong>.</p>

        <p>As <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> technologies advance, <strong>Smart Cities</strong> benefit from these innovations by providing more <strong>efficient services</strong> and optimizing <strong>resource usage</strong>. Generally, <strong>IoT</strong> is oriented towards <strong>technological infrastructure</strong>, while <strong>Smart Cities</strong> focus on meeting users' needs. However, both share the goal of improving <strong>urban services</strong>.</p>

        <p>The implementation of <strong>IoT</strong> in <strong>Smart Cities</strong>, as in other contexts, is associated with the use of an extensive <strong>hardware infrastructure</strong> composed of <strong>heterogeneous devices</strong>. This diversity is necessary for monitoring various environments, such as <strong>parks</strong>, <strong>parking lots</strong>, <strong>buildings</strong>, <strong>traffic</strong>, and <strong>atmospheric conditions</strong>. For example, in a park, specific <strong>sensors</strong> may be employed to monitor <strong>humidity</strong>, <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>gases in the air</strong>, the <strong>presence of people</strong>, and the control of <strong>public lighting</strong>. This scenario highlights the significant number of devices required in <strong>IoT infrastructures</strong> for <strong>Smart City solutions</strong>.</p>

        <p>Another relevant aspect is the <strong>heterogeneity</strong> of <strong>IoT infrastructures</strong>, which involves a wide variety of <strong>devices</strong> and <strong>communication protocols</strong>. Each device may have different <strong>processing capabilities</strong> and adopt varying <strong>communication standards</strong>, resulting in a lack of <strong>standardization</strong> across solutions. Combined with the large volume of devices, the <strong>management</strong>, <strong>monitoring</strong>, and <strong>maintenance</strong> of the availability and efficiency of these infrastructures become a significant challenge.</p>

        <p>In light of this, to ensure the availability and proper functioning of <strong>devices</strong> and the <strong>IoT infrastructure</strong>, remote <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>control</strong> of these devices are essential without overburdening <strong>operational resources</strong>. This enables the continuous operation of various <strong>services</strong> offered by <strong>Smart Cities</strong> and ensures the high availability of the <strong>IoT infrastructure</strong>.</p>

        <p>To achieve this goal, the development of <strong>management mechanisms</strong> capable of handling the specific characteristics of <strong>IoT infrastructures</strong> in the context of <strong>Smart Cities</strong> becomes necessary. This development must take into account the particularities and complexities of these environments. The creation of a dedicated <strong>architecture</strong> for <strong>device management</strong> can significantly contribute to ensuring the proper functioning and <strong>maintenance</strong> of these infrastructures.</p>

        <h2>2. Architectural Representation</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Integrated Architecture for IoT Device Management in Smart Cities (ArchM)</strong> is an architecture described in this document, aimed at enabling the development of platforms for managing devices that make up the infrastructure of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in the context of <strong>Smart Cities.</strong>

          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figura 1 - Overview of Infrastructure in Smart Cities</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>In <strong>Figure 1</strong>, it can be observed that a <strong>Smart City</strong> is composed of various distinct solutions, which often operate in isolation. Each of these solutions has its own characteristics, such as types and quantities of devices, communication protocols, running software, and data storage structures.</p>

        In this context, <strong>ArchM</strong> organizes management into two parts: the <strong>Smart City Solution</strong>, or simply <strong>Smart Solution (SS)</strong>, and the <strong>Composition of Smart Cities Solutions</strong>, or <strong>Smart Composition (SC)</strong>. <strong>SS</strong> refers to a specific solution for a <strong>Smart City</strong>, such as traffic monitoring on a highway, managed in isolation from <strong>ArchM</strong> perspective. On the other hand, <strong>SC</strong> represents a set of <strong>SS</strong>, meaning a group of <strong>Smart City</strong> solutions that are managed as a single solution.

        <h2>2.1 Management Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ArchM</strong> must meet certain management requirements, considered essential for the effective management of IoT infrastructures in <strong>Smart Cities</strong>. For this purpose, the <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong> and <strong>ISO/IEC 20924:2018</strong> standards were used in defining these requirements. The requirements are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Separation of Functional and Management Capabilities:</strong> All management resources must operate independently of functional resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heterogeneity:</strong> Management must be prepared to handle devices and systems with diverse characteristics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Highly Distributed Systems:</strong> Management must be capable of handling the high distribution of devices and systems that may exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Management must be maintained even as the number of devices connected to IoT systems increases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> The manager must utilize resource sharing among devices and systems to ensure the efficient operation of the entire infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2.2 Architectural Entities</h2>
        <p>
          This section presents the entities that are part of the scope covered by <strong>ArchM</strong>. In this context, architectural entities refer to the components present in IoT solutions that may be part of the set of elements involved in management, either as managed elements or as managing elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          These elements were defined based on the <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong> standard, which presents a reference architecture for the Internet of Things. However, in the implementation of a manager utilizing <strong>ArchM</strong>, there may be changes in the relationships or usage of the entities. <strong>Figure 2</strong> presents the conceptual model of <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong>, showing the relationships among the entities present in IoT solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The colored classes represent the elements deemed relevant from the conceptual model of <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong> for management in <strong>ArchM</strong>. In <strong>Figure 2</strong>, these elements are highlighted in distinct colors, allowing for clear visual identification. The meanings of each of these elements are presented below:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Green:</strong> represents the physical entities that may be managed.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> corresponds to the software used for management, always considering the separation between functional and management software.</li>
          <li><strong>Blue:</strong> related to all forms of storage for management information.</li>
          <li><strong>Orange:</strong> refers to the management platform based on ArchM that may exist within Smart Solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The architectural elements defined for management in <strong>ArchM</strong> adhere to some of the guidelines established in <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong>. These elements include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Gateway:</strong> responsible for connecting devices to the network or the internet, as well as abstracting the heterogeneity of the devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device:</strong> a hardware component that may consist of sensors and/or actuators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sensor:</strong> a hardware component used to capture environmental information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Actuator:</strong> a hardware component responsible for making modifications to the environment in which it is situated.

        <p>
          <strong>The Smart City Solution</strong>, or <strong>Smart Solution (SS)</strong>, is an IoT solution developed to address a specific need of a <strong>Smart City</strong>, such as vehicle traffic solutions, smart parking, or smart buildings. Each <strong>Smart City Solution</strong> consists of the following entities: devices, gateways, sensors, actuators, services, and data storage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Smart Manager (SM)</strong> refers to any service used for managing the entities within a <strong>Smart City Solution</strong>, which forms part of the management platform based on <strong>ArchM</strong>. It is important to note that not all solutions in a Smart City have an SM, as shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Composition of Smart City Solutions</strong>, or <strong>Smart Composition (SC)</strong>, is the combination of two or more <strong>SS</strong> in terms of management. This means that, despite the variety of <strong>SS</strong> in the management platform, there is a single group of elements that need to be managed. However, this is only feasible for <strong>SS</strong> that are already managed by an <strong>SM</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, which illustrates four <strong>SCs</strong>.

      <section id="device-layer">
        <h2>3. Device Layer</h2>
        <p>The device layer encompasses all types of physical assets that can be managed within an IoT infrastructure. In the <strong>ArchM</strong>, a device is defined as any hardware component connected to a Smart Solution that requires management.</p>
        <p>In the <strong>ArchM</strong>, gateways, sensors, and actuators are considered basic devices for management purposes. Additionally, a device can be composed of these basic devices. In this situation, the composite component is treated as a single unit for management purposes.</p>

      <section id="gateway">
        <h2>3.1 Gateway</h2>
        <p><strong>Gateways</strong> are robust and complex devices equipped with significant processing power and storage capacity compared to simpler devices like sensors and actuators. As illustrated in <strong>Figure 6</strong>, gateways serve to connect devices that lack direct communication capability with the Internet.</p>

        <p>In the context of <strong>ArchM</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>, gateways are responsible for executing functions that involve a certain degree of complexity. This enables the creation of functionality sets that can be distributed throughout a <strong>Smart City</strong>. The management resources that may exist in a gateway are described below:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The gateway is responsible for providing resources that allow devices without direct means of connecting to the infrastructure to communicate. Thus, the gateway acts as a bridge, mapping the device's communication protocol to an Internet communication protocol.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Due to its greater processing capacity, the gateway can offer resources to process the management data received from devices before sending it. This includes treatments such as aggregation and filtering, among others.</li>
          <li><strong>Service Execution:</strong> The gateway is also used to execute resources, allowing for the distribution of management services across various gateways within a Smart Solution.</li>
          <li><strong>Device Control:</strong> This functionality enables the control of devices connected to the gateway, allowing for remote changes, such as firmware updates, activation or deactivation of devices, and other operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The storage capacity of gateways is utilized to persist the most recent management data for two purposes: first, to allow accumulated data to be sent in a single message; and second, to ensure that only relevant data is sent.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="sensor">
        <h2>3.2 Sensor</h2>
        <p>Any device that has the ability to capture data from the environment in which it is placed for use by the <strong>Smart Solution</strong> is considered a <strong>sensor</strong> in the <strong>ArchM</strong>. Sensors can vary in type, but generally, they are simple devices and have different forms of connectivity. In the <strong>ArchM</strong>, the sensor is a basic device that is always connected to a <strong>gateway</strong>, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="actuator">
        <h2>3.3 Actuator</h2>
        <p>The <strong>actuator</strong> is a device that has the ability to make changes to the physical environment in which it is placed. Like <strong>sensors</strong>, actuators can vary in type and have different forms of communication. Although they may be more complex than sensors, they still require a <strong>gateway</strong> to connect to the internet, as shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.</p>

        <p>The devices present in <strong>IoT solutions</strong>, including those used in <strong>Smart Cities</strong>, exhibit a wide variety of characteristics, such as different communication, processing, and storage capabilities. This diversity creates the need to adopt methods that make these differences irrelevant during the development of platforms for managing such devices.</p>

        <p>Therefore, it is necessary to utilize protocols that adapt to the characteristics of the devices and are highly reliable to ensure efficient communication. Traditional protocols, such as those used on the web, may not be suitable for IoT devices. Below, we present some protocols that can be utilized by IoT devices:</p>

        <p><strong>Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP):</strong> Designed for constrained devices (with low energy, memory, and computing capabilities), such as sensor nodes, allowing the capture of values read by the devices. It utilizes the UDP protocol and supports multicast for IoT applications <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT):</strong> An open messaging protocol based on the publish/subscribe paradigm, used for lightweight communications. MQTT employs a client/server model, collecting data from sensors and sending it to a server (broker) <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP):</strong> An application layer protocol used to transfer information between applications or organizations. AMQP transmits data as a byte stream and supports reliability, flow control, authentication, among others <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>The Accessible Thing Universe - TATU:</strong> A protocol that extends MQTT, standardizing messages for communication between devices and gateways <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.</p>

        <p>These are examples of protocols used in the <strong>device layer</strong>. Thus, for the architecture development, it was necessary to define a layer that supports various protocols. <strong>Figure 7</strong> illustrates the device layer and its interaction with the <strong>communication layer</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 7</strong> illustrates some of the communication methods that devices can use within a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>. It is noted that <strong>ArchM</strong> does not impose restrictions on the communication methods of the devices, which is an essential feature in the context of <strong>Smart Cities</strong> due to the diversity of devices employed in different solutions.</p>

        <h2>3.5 Device Communication in ArchM</h2>
        <p><strong>ArchM</strong> will be applied in the creation of management platforms for IoT solutions in different scenarios within <strong>Smart Cities</strong>. This will standardize communication between various solutions, facilitating the sharing of management information. To achieve this goal, the communication protocol must implement appropriate message structures. <strong>Figure 8</strong> presents an example of how standardization in communication between a sensor and an IoT gateway can be achieved.</p>

        <p>As illustrated in <strong>Figure 8</strong>, a device initiates its communication with the <strong>gateway</strong> (which allows its connection to the internet) by sending its basic management information, essential for identification and registration. Additionally, the device also transmits sensory data along with the management data. This approach takes advantage of the opportunity to send both sensory and management data in a single packet, optimizing transmission.</p>

        <p>In a second instance, only the sensory data is sent, accompanied by the <strong>sensor identifier</strong>. With this identifier, it is possible to recognize which devices are connected to the gateway and fully operational. In the first transmission, the device also includes a timer, indicating the need to send information every 1000 milliseconds. This allows the gateway to detect the device's disconnection if it does not send data within this time interval.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figure%208%20-%20Device%20Communication.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" style="max-width: 45%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figure 8 - Device Communication</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>There is a continuous need for communication between the gateway and the device. Therefore, the gateway must be capable of sending commands to the connected devices. It is recommended to use protocols such as <strong>TATU</strong>, which extends <strong>MQTT</strong> and standardizes communication messages between IoT devices and gateways, using <strong>JSON</strong> notation.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figure%209%20-%20Device%20Operations.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" style="max-width: 45%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figure 9 - Device Operations </strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>The <strong>TATU</strong> protocol offers three specific methods for interacting with devices:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>GET:</strong> Collects real-time information from the device, without a defined periodicity.</li>
          <li><strong>SET:</strong> Allows for the alteration of device settings, as defined by another component.</li>
          <li><strong>FLOW:</strong> Requests data to be sent periodically every N seconds.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These operations allow for both the transmission of management information and the execution of management commands.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 9</strong> illustrates the dynamics of executing the <strong>TATU</strong> protocol. It presents three distinct moments, each related to one of the mentioned operations, considering that the device is already properly connected to the gateway.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Figure 9</strong>, the gateway makes a <strong>GET</strong> request, asking for the type of sensor, as seen in the device's response. In addition to the sensor type, the response also includes the ID and the value of the sensor, taking the opportunity to send this management information during regular communication.</p>

        <p>In the second moment, a <strong>SET</strong> request is made, which, although not detailed in <strong>Figure 9</strong>, is processed by the device without returning a result. This could represent an internal operation, such as temporarily disabling the device, for example.</p>

        <p>Finally, the <strong>FLOW</strong> operation will request that management parameters be sent to the gateway every time the sensor information is transmitted. However, if no information is sent within a predefined time interval, a specific message should be triggered, containing only the requested management data. This approach ensures that the gateway continues to receive critical management data even when sensor data is not transmitted regularly.</p>

        <h2>4. Communication Layer</h2>
        <p>The communication layer is responsible for managing all traffic of managerial information. To achieve this, it must be capable of supporting the various forms of communication possible in an IoT solution for <strong>Smart Cities</strong>. <strong>Figure 10</strong> presents the main modules of this layer and their interactions with the other components of the architecture.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Figure 10</strong>, it can be observed that the communication layer is composed of two main modules: the communication module and the action module. The communication module is responsible for providing interfaces that allow communication between different devices using their respective protocols. In turn, the action module is responsible for enabling access from the various layers to the devices.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="communication-module">
        <h2>4.1 Communication Module</h2>
        <p>As the module responsible for communication between different types of devices, this module must implement interfaces for each communication protocol used in the device layer. This allows for management operations such as <strong>GET</strong>, <strong>SET</strong>, and <strong>FLOW</strong> to be performed for any communication protocol.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figure%2011%20-%20Communication%20and%20actuation%20modules.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" style="max-width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

        </div>

        <p><strong>Figure 11</strong> details the interaction of the communication layer with the device, monitoring, maintenance, and intervention layers. First, devices send data through their standard protocols. Then, the communication module, which provides communication interfaces—represented by the <strong>MQTT</strong> and <strong>AMQP</strong> modules—captures the messages. Finally, the module extracts the management data, assembles a message in the appropriate format, and sends it to the monitoring layer. The same process occurs in the reverse direction, meaning from the upper layers to the devices.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 12</strong> demonstrates the message conversion operation. Initially, the message contains a variety of information, including sensing and management data. After passing through the communication layer, the message is altered. In the modified message, only the necessary management information for the monitoring layer is included at the second stage.</p>

        <p>The action module is responsible for enabling the other layers to communicate with the devices. As shown in <strong>Figure 10</strong>, in the <strong>ArchM</strong>, the monitoring, maintenance, and intervention layers are directly connected to the communication layer.</p>

        <p>Given the wide variety of existing devices, the communication module is also tasked with handling the conversion of commands sent by the monitoring, maintenance, and intervention layers to the devices. Thus, when the command reaches the action module, it is converted to the standard and communication format accepted by the device.

        <p>The <strong>Figure 13</strong> presents the sequence of steps taken to execute a command sent to the communication layer. After sending a command to the device, the communication layer identifies the command and the device responsible for its execution. Then, it performs the conversion of the command, if necessary, to the standard accepted by the device. When the device receives the command, it is executed.</p>

      <section id="communication-standard">
        <h2>4.3 Communication Standard</h2>
        <p>As described, communication can be carried out through different protocols. However, it will be necessary to implement basic routines for communication in the context of management for each protocol used. From this point, a generic overview will be provided on how each of the basic communication operations should be conducted within a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>.</p>

        <p>The operations can be divided into two categories: requests, which include two types—data request (<strong>GET</strong>) and flow request (<strong>FLOW</strong>) — and modifications (<strong>SET</strong>), which perform alteration operations on devices.</p>

        <p>The <strong>GET</strong> operation is responsible for requesting management data from devices. This data can be sent in standard sensing messages, either opportunistically or not. However, there may be a variation of the <strong>GET</strong> request for messages to be sent immediately. <strong>Figure 14</strong> details the execution of the management data request from a server to a device.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figure%2014%20-%20Sending%20command%20from%20server%20to%20device.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" style="max-width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figure 14 - Sending command from server to device</strong></p>
        </div>

        In <strong>Figure 14</strong>, each step of the execution is numbered, and the messages are detailed. Initially, a management server issues a <strong>GET</strong> request. It identifies the following parameters: 'type_request', 'id_gateway', 'id_device', 'command', and 'immediate'.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>type_request:</strong> indicates the type of request being made to the device (<strong>GET, FLOW, SET</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>id_gateway:</strong> contains the identification of the gateway that connects the device to the Internet (depending on the <strong>Smart Solution</strong>, this parameter may be omitted).</li>
          <li><strong>id_device:</strong> contains the identifier of the device that is to execute the command.</li>
          <li><strong>command:</strong> identifies the command to be executed by the device (<strong>RESET, TIME_ON, STATUS, INFO</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>immediate:</strong> specifies how the response should be handled, indicating whether the response should be embedded in a sensing message or sent as a separate message.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The communication layer intercepts the command sent from the server at the second stage. At this point, the message is converted into the format accepted by the device and then forwarded. In the third stage, there is a difference in the format of the message adapted to the device. It contains the following parameters:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>request:</strong> identifies the type of request made to the device (<strong>GET, FLOW, POST</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>command:</strong> this parameter contains the execution instructions for the device. It can have different variations depending on the device's protocol. In <strong>Figure 14</strong>, the command has two parameters: <strong>instruction</strong>, which specifies what is being requested, and <strong>immediate</strong>, which indicates how the response will be carried out.</li>
          <li><strong>timeout:</strong> indicates the device's response time, needed to determine whether the message was delivered and executed. If the time is exceeded, it is inferred that the message was not delivered.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In <strong>Figure 14</strong>, moment five shows the response being sent. One of the parameters in the message body contains the response data. It also includes information on the temperature (sensing data) and the device status (management data). This is due to the parameter <strong>immediate</strong>: “false”, indicating that management data should be sent along with the sensing messages, thereby reducing the number of messages on the network. The parameters in the <strong>status</strong> are described below.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>timestamp:</strong> identifies the moment when the management data was captured.</li>
          <li><strong>mode:</strong> identifies the device's operational mode at that time (<strong>OPERATIONAL</strong>, <strong>FAILURE</strong>, <strong>TEST</strong>, <strong>MAINTENANCE</strong>).</li>
          <li><strong>flow:</strong> indicates whether the sensing data is being sent via a stream.</li>
          <li><strong>power:</strong> displays data on the device's power consumption.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At moment six, the message is converted to the Internet communication standard, with a clear separation between the management data and the sensing data. The converted message is shown in moment six of <strong>Figure 14</strong>, where the control parameters are also presented, containing only the management data requested by the server.</p>

        <p>The <strong>FLOW</strong> operation is responsible for requesting management data from devices, similar to the <strong>GET</strong> operation. However, in this operation, a continuous flow of management data from the device is maintained at pre-determined intervals. <strong>Figure 15</strong> presents a generic example of the <strong>FLOW</strong> operation in use.</p>

        <p>Like the <strong>GET</strong> operation, the <strong>FLOW</strong> operation follows the same first four steps, with differences starting from step five. However, in steps one and three, a new parameter can be observed: <strong>time</strong>, which indicates the time interval for sending each message. It is important to note that, when using the <strong>FLOW</strong> operation, multiple requests are unnecessary, as management information is continuously sent.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figure%2015%20-%20Sending%20the%20flow%20command%20from%20the%20server%20to%20the%20device.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" style="max-width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figure 15 - Sending the flow command from the server to the device
            </strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>At moment seven, presented in <strong>Figure 15</strong>, the operation is divided into two parts. In moment 7A, after a certain amount of data is sent from the device to the communication layer — represented by moments five and six in <strong>Figure 15</strong> — the data is aggregated into a single message to be subsequently sent to the server. In moment 7B, the aggregated management data is presented in a single message to the server. It is worth noting that the aggregation shown is a generalization of what may occur, and in an implemented platform using the logic for the <strong>FLOW</strong> operation, the aggregation, message format, and other parameters may vary.</p>

        <p>The <strong>SET</strong> operation is designed to make modifications to devices in a Smart Solution, addressing both hardware and software aspects. On the hardware side, configurations like the state of an actuator (on/off) can be changed. On the software side, adjustments such as data collection intervals, operational modes, and firmware updates or modifications can be carried out. The <strong>SET</strong> operation, when sent from a server, is similar to the previously discussed <strong>GET</strong> and <strong>FLOW</strong> operations. <strong>Figure 16</strong> provides a generic example of how the <strong>SET</strong> operation is used.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figure%2016%20-%20Configuration%20command%20sent%20from%20server%20to%20device.png" alt="Descrição da imagem" style="max-width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figure 16 - Configuration command sent from server to device</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>At first, in <strong>Figure 16</strong>, it is observed that a <strong>SET</strong> request is sent, indicating that a modification should be made in a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>. Information about the gateway and the device that will execute the command is also sent; in this case, for the device shutdown.</p>

        <p>In the second stage, similar to the <strong>GET</strong> and <strong>FLOW</strong> operations, the request is converted by the communication layer into the communication standard accepted by the device. Then, in the third stage, the converted message is sent to the device. In the converted request, it is noted that only the identification of the operation type and the details of the command to be executed are present. In the fourth stage, the command is successfully executed by the device. It is important to note that this illustration does not show details about execution errors or communication failures.</p>

        <h2>5.1 Device Monitoring</h2>
        <p>The device monitoring module is responsible for collecting management data from the devices of a given <strong>Smart Solution</strong>. However, this data can be categorized based on the type of information it represents. In <strong>ArchM</strong>, the data is classified into hardware data and software data.</p>

        <p>Hardware monitoring deals exclusively with information related to the hardware of each device. However, this activity is not limited to monitoring and action devices used in the <strong>Smart Solution</strong> but also includes the gateways that connect these devices to the internet. In <strong>ArchM</strong>, the following basic data is considered essential for device monitoring:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> id, name, manufacturer, serial number, model, power supply, battery level, total memory, free memory, total processing capacity, free processing capacity, storage capacity, MAC address, IP address, connection type, and operating system.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensing Devices:</strong> id, name, manufacturer, serial number, model, power supply, battery level, version, sensor type, unit of measurement, and measurement interval.</li>
          <li><strong>Actuating Devices:</strong> id, name, manufacturer, serial number, model, power supply, battery level, type of actuation, and actuation method.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is worth noting that the gateway, being a more complex device, provides information such as the operating system, processing capacity, storage, and other details. Sensing devices, on the other hand, include the measurement interval attribute, which indicates the frequency of data transmission. Actuating devices have the actuation method attribute, which defines the type of modification they perform.</p>

        <p>Software monitoring is responsible for managing information related to the software present on gateways, allowing the monitoring of the type, version, and function of each software. The basic data regarding software management in a Smart Solution includes: developer, version, software type, and execution location. This category encompasses both the firmware of the devices and the software installed on gateways. The management data presented here are not intended to limit what should be monitored, but rather to provide guidance, allowing for modifications according to specific needs.</p>

Initially, the device sends its management information to the communication layer, which, as described earlier, performs the conversion and/or filtering of the message, if necessary. Subsequently, the data is sent to the monitoring layer. In this layer, the data is redirected to the appropriate module, either hardware or software, where it will be processed for storage purposes. Additionally, the data captured by the monitoring layer can be requested before being stored, for instance, for applications requiring real-time processing.

Subsequently, the data can undergo two types of conversion: the first aimed at local storage and the second for remote storage.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 20</strong> presents an example of data processing. In the first step, the management data received by the management module is forwarded for processing. It can be observed that there is a set of data from a specific device, collected at different times.</p>

        <p>The data received by the processing module is processed and then aggregated, divided, and used to construct different messages. In steps three and four, the data is stored in two distinct databases, each with the appropriate format for its respective use.</p>

        <p>This layer defines the necessary routines to perform corrections or maintenance on the devices and software. Routines such as rebooting, modifying software configurations, locking devices, and running simulations must be clearly defined for each type of device, considering their distinct characteristics and resources.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Figure 21</strong>, it can be seen that the maintenance layer is related to the storage component. This is due to the need to access the characteristics and configurations of the devices being maintained. Additionally, the maintenance layer connects to the communication layer and the devices because of the requirement to transfer configuration and modification commands to the devices integrated into the <strong>Smart Solution</strong>.</p>

        <p>The maintenance layer, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 21</strong>, consists of three fundamental modules:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Hardware and Software Maintenance:</strong> Responsible for defining the basic operations that can be performed on the hardware and/or software assets within a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>.</li>

        <p>This module is responsible for managing the operations that can be performed on the assets of a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>, defining which actions are feasible for each asset to be maintained.</p>

        <p>As illustrated in <strong>Figure 21</strong>, the hardware and software maintenance module is interconnected with the device access module and the storage layer. By accessing the management data, this module identifies the operations that can be executed on the asset or the <strong>Smart Solution</strong> in question.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 22</strong> presents the sequence diagram of the hardware and software maintenance module. In the first moment, there is a request from an entity to perform a maintenance action, which can originate from a higher layer or an external software. Next, the hardware and software maintenance module is triggered to execute the requested task on the device. Before proceeding, the module checks the storage layer to see which properties are available for modification on the devices and software. After this verification, access to the device is requested. The hardware and software maintenance module then sends the request to the device control, which, in turn, forwards the request to the device. Finally, upon receiving a response, it is sent back to the entity that originated the maintenance request.</p>

        <h2>7.1 Device Analysis in Smart Solution</h2>
        <p>The Device Analysis module in a <strong>Smart Solution</strong> is responsible for generating an overview of the managed device infrastructure. To achieve this, it leverages the data retrieval module from the storage component, which allows access to the necessary data to assess the current state of the infrastructure. The Device Analysis module also utilizes two other modules: the Data Processing module and the View Generator. <strong>Figure 24</strong> illustrates a possible execution sequence of the Device Analysis module in a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the diagram, it is observed that the Device Analysis module in the <strong>Smart Solution</strong> interacts with other modules and layers. Initially, an entity, which may be a manager or software, requests an analysis, specifying which set of assets should be analyzed.</p>

        <p>Next, the Device Analysis module retrieves the necessary management data for monitoring the requested assets. In <strong>Figure 24</strong>, the data request is directed to the storage module, which may include historical data stored on devices distributed across the infrastructure.</p>

        <p>After collecting the necessary data to compose the current infrastructure scenario, the analysis module may request data formatting from the Data Processing module. This is due to the diversity of sources from which the data is collected. Although the data may have already been processed, there is a risk that it is not in a compatible format for processing.</p>

        <p>The Device Analysis module may also perform some data structuring after standardization, depending on the needs of the View Generator module. Finally, the View Generator will create a general representation of the selected infrastructure and return the result to the analysis module, which, in turn, will send the response to the requesting entity.</p>

The diagram presented in <strong>Figure 24</strong> shows that the Data Processing module may or may not be utilized during the analysis, which applies to all modules.</p>

        <p>In addition to standardizing the data, this module is also responsible for data cleansing, if necessary. This involves the elimination of duplicate, incomplete, or any other inconsistent records. Thus, depending on the types of data structures used, the Data Processing module can be implemented in a customized manner to handle specific structures.</p>

        <p>Similar to the example presented in <strong>Figure 20</strong>, this module can remove irrelevant data for the analysis. <strong>Figure 25</strong> illustrates an example of data processing, where the Device Analysis module sends a dataset—presented separately in the figure for illustrative purposes (moments 1 and 1A). After sending the data, the processing module performs conversion using the implemented logic. Subsequently, the processed data is returned to the Device Analysis module.

          The <strong>Fault Identification</strong> module is responsible for detecting potential failures that may occur in a <strong>Smart Solution</strong>. It coordinates the retrieval of relevant data and requests the current status of the <strong>Smart Solution</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 28</strong>, through connections with the storage and analysis layer modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diagram in <strong>Figure 29</strong> presents a generic execution sequence of this module. Initially, there is a request made to the <strong>Fault Identification</strong> module. Subsequently, the module requests the status of the devices from the analysis layer, specifically from the <strong>Device Analysis</strong> module in the <strong>Smart Solution</strong>. After this step, the module retrieves historical data to assist in identifying failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, the <strong>strategy analysis</strong> module defines which possible actions (scenarios) can be executed to resolve the issue. Finally, the <strong>scenario generator</strong> determines which scenario will be used, as only one of the scenarios will be chosen as the potential cause of the failures in the <strong>Smart Solution</strong>. It is important to note that this scenario can be predefined, which would exclude these steps.

        <p>
          The <strong>Strategy Analyzer</strong> module is utilized by all <strong>fault identification</strong> modules, as shown in <strong>Figure 28</strong>. This module is responsible for using the data transferred by the identification modules to define which actions can be taken to correct the failure. For example, if the <strong>fault identification</strong> module determines that a gateway is experiencing a high delay in sending information, the <strong>Strategy Analyzer</strong> module must identify different sets of actions that can resolve the gateway issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Figure 30</strong>, it can be observed that this module may not need to create actions to correct the failure but can rely on a set of pre-established strategies. In this situation, the module simply forwards which sets of actions can be executed to the <strong>scenario generator</strong> module. However, there is nothing preventing the implementation of a solution where actions are generated dynamically.

        <h2>9.4 Intervention on Devices in the Smart Composition</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Device Intervention Module</strong> handles the modifications that need to be made in the <strong>Smart Composition</strong> to address the problems identified by the <strong>Fault Identification Layer</strong>. It leverages auxiliary components like the <strong>Intervention Generator</strong> and <strong>Intervention Analysis</strong>. Additionally, it uses the <strong>Storage Layer</strong> to retrieve data that assists in defining the intervention approach, as well as the <strong>Fault Identification</strong> and <strong>Maintenance modules</strong> to carry out the necessary modifications. It’s important to note that communication with the devices is conducted through another module, called <strong>Maintenance Intervention</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 35</strong> presents the execution sequence of the <strong>Device Intervention Module</strong>. In it, we see a request made by an entity, which would be the <strong>Problem Identification Layer</strong>. The module then requests the necessary data from the <strong>Problem Identification</strong> and <strong>Storage layers</strong>. From this point, the <strong>Intervention Generator</strong> and <strong>Intervention Analysis modules</strong> define the best strategy for modifying the devices in the <strong>Smart Composition</strong>. Finally, the <strong>Maintenance Intervention Layer</strong> communicates with the <strong>Smart Composition</strong> to implement the necessary modifications.</p>

        <h2>9.5 Maintenance by Intervention</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Maintenance Intervention Module</strong> is responsible for managing communication between the <strong>Intervention Layer</strong> and the <strong>Maintenance Layer</strong> to implement intervention configurations in <strong>Smart Solutions</strong>. To achieve this, the module must coordinate the transmission of configuration data to each <strong>Smart Solution</strong>, taking into account the communication characteristics and specific standards of each solution.</p>

        <h2>10. Storage Layer</h2>
        <p>All storage resources utilized in the <strong>ArchM</strong> are considered part of the <strong>storage layer</strong>, which encompasses everything from cloud databases to temporary storage on simple devices. Thus, the <strong>storage layer</strong> is responsible for coordinating the storage and retrieval of management data within the infrastructure.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 36</strong> presents the components of the <strong>storage layer</strong> and their relationships. This layer consists of three modules: <strong>data storage management</strong>, <strong>data retrieval management</strong>, and <strong>data sharing</strong>. The <strong>Storage Base Search</strong> module is responsible for the logic of searching for data distributed across different databases. It can be implemented as a separate module or integrated into another module, depending on the chosen approach. It is important to emphasize that, in an implementation of the <strong>ArchM</strong>, some functionalities of these modules may be executed by existing solutions in storage services.</p>

        <h2>10.1 Management Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The <strong>management data storage module</strong> is responsible for receiving management information from the <strong>monitoring layer</strong> and appropriately storing it in various databases that may be in use. This module also uses the <strong>Storage Base Search</strong> to coordinate the distributed storage of the received management information. Although not depicted in <strong>Figure 36</strong>, other layers may utilize this module to store data.</p>

        <h2>10.2 Management Data Recover</h2>
        <p>This module is responsible for querying the <strong>distributed management data</strong> and returning it as a set of information formatted according to the requester’s needs. To do this, it uses the <strong>Storage Base Search module</strong> to retrieve the distributed data and the <strong>data sharing module</strong> to meet the specific characteristics of the requester.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="data-sharing">
        <h2>10.3 Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The <strong>data sharing module</strong> addresses issues related to the use of <strong>management data</strong> by different management solutions. For example, the <strong>management data</strong> produced by a Smart Solution can be used to select intervention strategies in a Smart Composition. Additionally, the <strong>data sharing module</strong> manages the logic of external access to <strong>management data</strong>, allowing third-party applications that are not directly linked to the Smart Solution to access this information.</p>

        <h2>10.4 Storage Base Search</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Storage Base Search</strong>, as presented in Figure 36, is not considered a native module, since its functionalities will likely be performed by existing technological solutions. However, it is responsible for determining where the <strong>management data</strong> will be stored and what format will be used, taking into account the needs for managing the infrastructure.</p>
