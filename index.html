        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Smart Cities</strong> can be defined as urban centers that utilize digital <strong>data-driven technologies</strong> to optimize public services and increase <strong>resource use efficiency</strong>. A <strong>Smart City</strong> is composed of six main components: <strong>smart governance</strong>, <strong>smart economy</strong>, <strong>smart citizens</strong>, <strong>smart mobility</strong>, <strong>smart environment</strong>, and <strong>smart quality of life</strong>.</p>

        <p>As <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> technologies advance, <strong>Smart Cities</strong> benefit from these innovations by providing more <strong>efficient services</strong> and optimizing <strong>resource usage</strong>. Generally, <strong>IoT</strong> is oriented towards <strong>technological infrastructure</strong>, while <strong>Smart Cities</strong> focus on meeting users' needs. However, both share the goal of improving <strong>urban services</strong>.</p>

        <p>The implementation of <strong>IoT</strong> in <strong>Smart Cities</strong>, as in other contexts, is associated with the use of an extensive <strong>hardware infrastructure</strong> composed of <strong>heterogeneous devices</strong>. This diversity is necessary for monitoring various environments, such as <strong>parks</strong>, <strong>parking lots</strong>, <strong>buildings</strong>, <strong>traffic</strong>, and <strong>atmospheric conditions</strong>. For example, in a park, specific <strong>sensors</strong> may be employed to monitor <strong>humidity</strong>, <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>gases in the air</strong>, the <strong>presence of people</strong>, and the control of <strong>public lighting</strong>. This scenario highlights the significant number of devices required in <strong>IoT infrastructures</strong> for <strong>Smart City solutions</strong>.</p>

        <p>Another relevant aspect is the <strong>heterogeneity</strong> of <strong>IoT infrastructures</strong>, which involves a wide variety of <strong>devices</strong> and <strong>communication protocols</strong>. Each device may have different <strong>processing capabilities</strong> and adopt varying <strong>communication standards</strong>, resulting in a lack of <strong>standardization</strong> across solutions. Combined with the large volume of devices, the <strong>management</strong>, <strong>monitoring</strong>, and <strong>maintenance</strong> of the availability and efficiency of these infrastructures become a significant challenge.</p>

        <p>In light of this, to ensure the availability and proper functioning of <strong>devices</strong> and the <strong>IoT infrastructure</strong>, remote <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>control</strong> of these devices are essential without overburdening <strong>operational resources</strong>. This enables the continuous operation of various <strong>services</strong> offered by <strong>Smart Cities</strong> and ensures the high availability of the <strong>IoT infrastructure</strong>.</p>

        <p>To achieve this goal, the development of <strong>management mechanisms</strong> capable of handling the specific characteristics of <strong>IoT infrastructures</strong> in the context of <strong>Smart Cities</strong> becomes necessary. This development must take into account the particularities and complexities of these environments. The creation of a dedicated <strong>architecture</strong> for <strong>device management</strong> can significantly contribute to ensuring the proper functioning and <strong>maintenance</strong> of these infrastructures.</p>

        <h2>2. Architectural Representation</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Integrated Architecture for IoT Device Management in Smart Cities (ArchM)</strong> is an architecture described in this document, aimed at enabling the development of platforms for managing devices that make up the infrastructure of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in the context of <strong>Smart Cities.</strong>

          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NilSousa16/archm.github.io/main/Figures/Figura%201%20-%20Overview%20of%20Infrastructure%20in%20Smart%20Cities.png" alt="Descrição da imagem">
          <p class="image-description"><strong>Figura 1 - Overview of Infrastructure in Smart Cities</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>In <strong>Figure 1</strong>, it can be observed that a <strong>Smart City</strong> is composed of various distinct solutions, which often operate in isolation. Each of these solutions has its own characteristics, such as types and quantities of devices, communication protocols, running software, and data storage structures.</p>

        In this context, <strong>ArchM</strong> organizes management into two parts: the <strong>Smart City Solution</strong>, or simply <strong>Smart Solution (SS)</strong>, and the <strong>Composition of Smart Cities Solutions</strong>, or <strong>Smart Composition (SC)</strong>. <strong>SS</strong> refers to a specific solution for a <strong>Smart City</strong>, such as traffic monitoring on a highway, managed in isolation from <strong>ArchM</strong> perspective. On the other hand, <strong>SC</strong> represents a set of <strong>SS</strong>, meaning a group of <strong>Smart City</strong> solutions that are managed as a single solution.

      <section id="management-requirements">
        <h2>2.1 Management Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ArchM</strong> must meet certain management requirements, considered essential for the effective management of IoT infrastructures in <strong>Smart Cities</strong>. For this purpose, the <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong> and <strong>ISO/IEC 20924:2018</strong> standards were used in defining these requirements. The requirements are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Separation of Functional and Management Capabilities:</strong> All management resources must operate independently of functional resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heterogeneity:</strong> Management must be prepared to handle devices and systems with diverse characteristics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Highly Distributed Systems:</strong> Management must be capable of handling the high distribution of devices and systems that may exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Management must be maintained even as the number of devices connected to IoT systems increases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> The manager must utilize resource sharing among devices and systems to ensure the efficient operation of the entire infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="architectural-entities">
        <h2>2.2 Architectural Entities</h2>
        <p>
          This section presents the entities that are part of the scope covered by <strong>ArchM</strong>. In this context, architectural entities refer to the components present in IoT solutions that may be part of the set of elements involved in management, either as managed elements or as managing elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          These elements were defined based on the <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong> standard, which presents a reference architecture for the Internet of Things. However, in the implementation of a manager utilizing <strong>ArchM</strong>, there may be changes in the relationships or usage of the entities. <strong>Figure 2</strong> presents the conceptual model of <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong>, showing the relationships among the entities present in IoT solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The colored classes represent the elements deemed relevant from the conceptual model of <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong> for management in <strong>ArchM</strong>. In <strong>Figure 2</strong>, these elements are highlighted in distinct colors, allowing for clear visual identification. The meanings of each of these elements are presented below:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Green:</strong> represents the physical entities that may be managed.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> corresponds to the software used for management, always considering the separation between functional and management software.</li>
          <li><strong>Blue:</strong> related to all forms of storage for management information.</li>
          <li><strong>Orange:</strong> refers to the management platform based on ArchM that may exist within Smart Solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The architectural elements defined for management in <strong>ArchM</strong> adhere to some of the guidelines established in <strong>ISO/IEC 30141:2018</strong>. These elements include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Gateway:</strong> responsible for connecting devices to the network or the internet, as well as abstracting the heterogeneity of the devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device:</strong> a hardware component that may consist of sensors and/or actuators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sensor:</strong> a hardware component used to capture environmental information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Actuator:</strong> a hardware component responsible for making modifications to the environment in which it is situated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Services<sup>¹</sup>:</strong> a software component tasked with data capture, environmental interaction, and communication.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="footnote">
          <strong>¹</strong> The minimum management is performed on the services (software) existing within an IoT infrastructure, as the primary focus is on the management of devices.

        <h2>2.3 Smart City Solution and Composition of Smart City Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The Smart City Solution</strong>, or <strong>Smart Solution (SS)</strong>, is an IoT solution developed to address a specific need of a <strong>Smart City</strong>, such as vehicle traffic solutions, smart parking, or smart buildings. Each <strong>Smart City Solution</strong> consists of the following entities: devices, gateways, sensors, actuators, services, and data storage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Smart Manager (SM)</strong> refers to any service used for managing the entities within a <strong>Smart City Solution</strong>, which forms part of the management platform based on <strong>ArchM</strong>. It is important to note that not all solutions in a Smart City have an SM, as shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Composition of Smart City Solutions</strong>, or <strong>Smart Composition (SC)</strong>, is the combination of two or more <strong>SS</strong> in terms of management. This means that, despite the variety of <strong>SS</strong> in the management platform, there is a single group of elements that need to be managed. However, this is only feasible for <strong>SS</strong> that are already managed by an <strong>SM</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, which illustrates four <strong>SCs</strong>.
